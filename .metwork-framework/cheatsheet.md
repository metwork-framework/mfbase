# MetWork/mfbase cheatsheet



## `root` service commands

As `root` unix user:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `service metwork start` | start all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork stop` | stop all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork status` | check all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork start mfbase` | start mfbase metwork services |
| `service metwork stop mfbase` | stop mfbase metwork services |
| `service metwork status mfbase` | check mfbase metwork services |

> Note: if you don't have `service` command on your Linux distribution, you can use `/etc/rc.d/init.d/metwork` instead of `service metwork`. For example: `/etc/rc.d/init.d/metwork start` instead of `service metwork start`. If your Linux distribution uses `systemd`component, you can also start metwork services with classic `systemctl` commands.



## root files or directories

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/metwork.config.d/mfbase/config.ini` | override the `mfbase` module configuration at system level (note: the first line of this file must be `[INCLUDE_config.ini]`) |
| `/opt/metwork-mfbase/config/config.ini` | default `mfbase` module configuration (useful to see all configuration options) (**do not edit this file** => use the overriding previous file) |
| `/etc/metwork.config.d/mfbase/external_plugins/` | put some `.plugin` files here and they will be installed during `mfbase` service startup |


## "load environment" commands

As a "not metwork" unix user (useless if you are logged as a "mfxxx" unix user as the "metwork environement" is already loaded):

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `source /opt/metwork-mfbase/share/interactive_profile` | load the mfbase metwork interactive environment |
| `source /opt/metwork-mfbase/share/profile` | load the mfbase metwork environment (same as above but without fancy stuff about banner, colors and prompt) |
| `/opt/metwork-mfbase/bin/mfbase_wrapper {YOUR_COMMAND}`| execute the given command in the mfbase metwork environment without changing anything to the current environment |

> Note: if you don't have `/opt/metwork-mfbase` symbolic link, use `/opt/metwork-mfbase-{BRANCH}` instead.

## module commands


As `mfbase` user:


| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `mfbase.start` | start mfbase services |
| `mfbase.stop` | stop mfbase services |
| `mfbase.status` | check mfbase services |
| `layers` | list installed layers (loaded layers are prefixed by `(*)`), `layers --help` for more details |
| `layer_load {LAYER_NAME}` | load the given layer (which must be installed), example: `layer_load python2_devtools@mfext` |
| `layer_unload` | unload the given layer (which must be loaded), example: `layer_unload python2@mfext` | 
| `components` | list installed software components (loaded components are prefixed by `(*)`), `components --help` for more details | 
| `metwork_debug` | debug the current environment (layers, paths, versions...), useful for debugging or bug reporting |
| `outside {YOUR_COMMAND}`| execute the given command outside the metwork environment without changing anything to to the current environment |


## plugins management commands

As `mfbase` unix user:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `plugins.list` | list installed plugins |
| `plugins.install {/full/path/file.plugin}` | install the given plugin file |
| `plugins.uninstall {plugin_name}` | uninstall the given plugin name (the "plugin name" is given in the first column of the `plugins.list` output) |
| `plugins.info {plugin_name}` | get some informations about the given plugin name (must be installed) |
| `plugins.info {/full/path/file.plugin}` | get some informations about the given plugin file (does not need to be installed) |
| `plugin_env {plugin_name}` | enter (interactively) in the given plugin environment |
| `plugin_wrapper {plugin_name} {YOUR_COMMAND}` | execute the given command in the given plugin environment (without changing anything to your current environment), useful for cron jobs |



## plugins development commands and files

### bootstrapping

As `mfbase` unix user:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bootstrap_plugin.py list` | list available plugin templates |
| `bootstrap_plugin.py create --template={TEMPLATE} {PLUGIN_NAME}` | bootstrap a plugin directory `{PLUGIN_NAME}` from the given template  |

### interesting files inside the plugin directory

| Relative path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`config.ini`** | main plugin configuration file |
| **`Makefile`** | build configuration file (you probably don't need to touch this unless you have specific build directives to add to the `custom::` target) |
| `crontab` | plugin crontab (use something like `* * * * * {{MFBASE_HOME}}/bin/cronwrap.sh -l -e -- plugin_wrapper {YOUR_PLUGIN_NAME} {YOUR_COMMAND} >>{{MODULE_RUNTIME_HOME}}/log/your_command.log 2>&1` for each line to execute your command in your plugin environement) |
| `local/` | local subdirectory (it mainly holds the python virtualenv), never touch this it's automatically generated) |
| `bin/` | if you put an executable in this directory, it will be available in `PATH` (in your plugin environment) |
| `lib/` | thie library directory will be available in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and in `PYTHONPATH` (in your plugin environment), so you can put here shared libraries or python files you want to include easily |
| `postinstall` | if this executable file is present during plugin installation, it will be automatically executed in the plugin environment just after the installation |
| **`.layerapi2_label`** | layerapi2 file to hold the plugin name as `plugin_{plugin name}@module_in_lowercase` |
| **`.layerapi2_dependencies`** | layerapi2 file to hold the layers to load when entering the plugin environment (you can also put some plugins with the syntax `plugin_{other plugin name}@module_in_lowercase` to inherit from another plugin |
### building

As `mfbase` unix user, inside a plugin directory (you must have a `Makefile` and `config.ini` files inside the current working directory):

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `make develop`| install the current plugin in "development mode" (devlink)  |
| `make release`| release the current plugin as a `.plugin` file |
| `make`| refresh the `virtualenv` or `node_modules` from requirements file |
| `make clean` | "clean" the current plugin and keep only "non generated" files and directories (you should commit the remaining ones to your favorite version control system) ; after that, use `make` to regenerate the `virtualenv` or `node_modules` |
| `make superclean` | same as `clean` target but also drop `requirements2.txt`, `requirements3.txt` and/or `package-lock.json` which can lead to a dependencies update (they are not frozen anymore) during next `make` call |

> Note: mandatory files are in **bold**, all these files are not created by default (it mainly depends on the template you used) but you can create them afterwards.
