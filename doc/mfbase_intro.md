# Introduction to MFBASE

.. index:: PostgreSQL, PostGIS
## What is mfbase?

MFBASE is the storage module of the Metwork framework. It allows you to easily and quickly install a database.

Currently, Metwork supplies only [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org/) / [PostGIS](http://postgis.refractions.net/). You could check the current :index:`PostgreSQL/PostGIS version` :ref:`here <mfext:layer_scientific_core:packages>`

In the near future, some other :index:`database engine` will be available in Metwork.

If you make your first steps with MFBASE, we prompt you to check the :doc:`mfbase_quick_start` section to discover the MFBASE features.

## Why would I use mfbase?

If you need a 'ready to use' database engine, MFBASE is the module you need.

When you create a PostgreSQL database from MFBASE, the most popular PostgreSQL and PostGIS extensions are installed and available.
